# WeightTrackerApp
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

- WeightTracker is an application designed to help users track their daily weight and monitor their progress towards their goal weight. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate through its components. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

- In order to support a large userbase, the user must first create an account using a username and password, which they can then use to log into the system via authentication. Once authenticated, the main activity of the application involves a list of daily weights and three options to manage different aspects of the application including adding, editing and removing daily weights. When adding a new weight, the app automatically generates a date reflecting when the new entry was submitted into the database. Additionally, the user can press the "star" icon to set a goal weight for themselves. The settings icon upons a new view in which the user can set SMS notification preferences, which are used to notify the user when they have successfully reached their goal weight.
